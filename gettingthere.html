                                <h2><strong>Getting There</strong></h2>
     
      <h3>By Plane</h3>
      <p>Lapu-Lapu City is located in Mactan Island, Cebu,  Philippines, so the fastest way to get to Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu, Philippines is  by air. The Mactan-Cebu InternationalAirport is located in Lapu-Lapu City where  foreign visitors, local visitors and residents may fly direct to Cebu.  Lapu-Lapu City is also the domestic air hub of the Philippines with close to 60  flights daily on average to and from popular destinations and key cities all  over the archipelago such as Manila, Kalibo, Puerto Princesa, Boracay, Clark,  Siargao (Surigao), Zamboanga, Davao, Bacolod, Iloilo, Cagayan de Oro, Camiguin,  General Santos, and Leyte.Charter flights are also available in some select  destinations especially China, Russia and the USA.</p>

<h3>By Boat
</h3>
      <p>As part of Cebu Province, going to Lapu-Lapu City is thru  Cebu City's domestic port which is the biggest and busiest in the island. Then  you can take taxi to Lapu-Lapu City that cost less than $US3.00 or take ferry  boat from Pier 3 to Muelle Osmena that cost less than US$0.25</p>

      <p>Large  passenger ferries with a capacity of 2,000 to 4,000 passengers ply the more  distant routes such as Manila, Davao, Zamboanga and Cagayan de Oro.  Medium-sized vessels such as the roll-on/roll-off (roro) types ply nearer  destinations while fast ferries transport passengers to and from neighboring  islands in two hours or less depending on the destination.</p>

Drivers however may bargain if they notice that you are a tourist, hence the  cost of the trip may double in price. However, you have the option not to agree  and may report such to local authorities. If you know the name of the building,  establishment, area or street you wish you reach, this is still the fastest way  to get to your destination.</p>
